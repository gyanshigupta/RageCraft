RageCraft: Temple of Wrath

“In the forgotten sands of Egypt lies a temple built not for gods — but for rage.”

RageCraft is an interactive web game where players release their bottled-up frustration by destroying and rebuilding an ancient temple block by block. Each click symbolizes controlled chaos — destruction that leads to creation.
