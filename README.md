🦂 RageCraft: Temple of Wrath
“In the forgotten sands of Egypt lies a temple built not for gods — but for rage.”
RageCraft is an interactive web game where players release their bottled-up frustration by destroying and rebuilding an ancient Egyptian temple block by block.
Each click symbolizes controlled chaos — destruction that leads to creation.
